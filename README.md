Overview
ChainTix uses a three-contract modular system to manage the minting of secret-code-based digital collectibles (POAPs) on Polkadot Asset Hub.

Each component is optimized for gas-efficiency, security, and scalability while staying within Polkadotâ€™s 49 KB contract deployment limit.

ðŸ›  Contract 1: SecretCodeManager.sol
Purpose:

Manages secret codes securely and tracks per-user usage.

Key Functions:

addSecret(bytes32 hashedSecret, string memory uri):
Adds a new event secret and links it to an IPFS metadata URI. Enables infinite event expansion without redeployments.

verifyAndMarkUsed(bytes32 hashedSecret, address user) returns (string):
Verifies if the secret is valid, ensures the wallet has not used it yet, marks it as used, and returns the metadata URI for minting.

hasUserMinted(bytes32 hashedSecret, address user):
Read-only check to see if a wallet has already minted with a given secret.

Security:

Secret words are hashed off-chain (SHA-256 or similar) before storage.

No plain-text secrets are stored on-chain, preventing scanning/cheating.

Scalability:

New secret codes can be added anytime by calling addSecret(), supporting continuous event launches without needing new contracts.

ðŸ›  Contract 2: SecretPOAPNFT.sol
Purpose:

Handles the minting and management of ERC-721 digital collectibles.

Key Functions:

mint(address to, string memory uri):
Mints a new NFT to a user with the provided IPFS metadata URI.

updateMinter(address newMinter):
Restricts minting rights to the Router contract after initial deployment.

Security:

Initially, the deployer had minting rights.

After deployment, mint rights were transferred to the Router contract using updateMinter().

Prevents unauthorized NFT minting.

Minimalist Design:

Focused only on minting and ownership functions to stay gas-efficient and within Polkadot's 49 KB limit.

ðŸ›  Contract 3: SecretPOAPRouter.sol
Purpose:

Handles user interactions and mint flow logic.

Key Functions:

mintWithSecret(string memory secretWord):
Accepts user input, hashes it, verifies it with the Manager, and mints an NFT if valid.

setSecretCodeManager(address _manager):
Updates the SecretCodeManager address (admin-only).

setNFTContract(address _nft):
Updates the NFT contract address (admin-only).

Security:

Only allows minting if the secret is verified and unused for the wallet.

Central controller ensuring users can't bypass security and mint directly.

ðŸ”’ Key Security Features
Hashed Secrets:
Secrets are never exposed on-chain. Users must genuinely know the correct secret to mint.

Single-Use Protection:
Each wallet can only mint once per secret.

Upgradeable System:
Admins can update Secret Manager or NFT contract addresses without redeploying the entire Router.

Only Authorized Minting:
NFT contract only accepts minting calls from the authorized Router.

ðŸ”— System Interaction Flow
User connects wallet and submits a secret word on the frontend.

Frontend hashes the secret word.

Router calls verifyAndMarkUsed() on Manager:

Verifies secret.

Marks the secret as used for that wallet.

Fetches metadata URI.

Router then calls mint() on NFT contract:

NFT is minted with the returned metadata.

User receives the collectible in their wallet.

âœ… Final Summary
This smart contract architecture ensures that only real event attendees can mint their POAPs, secrets are protected on-chain, mass minting scales smoothly with Polkadot's Elastic Coretime, and new events can be added without disruption.
